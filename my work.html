                <p>Project 1: I created a simple, single-page website dedicated to the character Killua Zoldyck from the anime *Hunter x Hunter*. The website features a clean, minimalist design to highlight Killua's key traits and journey. It includes a brief biography, showcasing his background as a skilled assassin and his growth throughout the series. The color scheme and imagery are inspired by Killua’s character. Overall, the website provides a concise and engaging tribute to Killua in a user-friendly format. However, it’s not perfect, as this was my first time coding a website.</p>
